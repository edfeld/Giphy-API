# Giphy-API
GIPHY API - Fun with animated GIPH files. 

This is the Giphy API written by Ed Einfeld.

The user is presented with a set of buttons that represent sports topics.  When the user clicks on a button, 10 Gifs are created on the page that relate to that sports topic.  When a user clicks on another button, 10 more GIF's are presented on the screen.  These GIFS will prepend the existing GIF's and display at the top of the page. 

GIF's are rendered as still images.  When a user clicks on a still GIF, the GIF will animate.  The user can click on the GIF and again and it will return to the still image. 

Users can add Topic buttons by using the "Add a Sport!" input form.  To add a Topic, the user inputs text into the input field and presses the "Add a Sport" button.
